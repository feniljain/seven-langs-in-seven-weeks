# About:

- This is a repo hosting code for exercises as well as experiments done while reading book: [Seven Languages In Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/)
- For each language I have included a flake.nix to easily experiment with the code
- Currently completing the book as a part of [README Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crk0t5j3icg)
